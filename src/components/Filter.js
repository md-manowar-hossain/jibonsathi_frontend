        Application for permission to go on a study tour Air, We, the students
        of class X of your school, beg to state that we wish to make a study
        tour to Jufflong. We feel that mere reading of books cannot make our
        knowledge complete unless we see the things with our own eyes. Study
        tour is not only interesting but also instructive. It widens our
        knowledge of history and tradition. It also broadens our outlook.
        Moreover, monotonous classes make our life dull and boring. The tour
        would relieve us from this monotony of our routine life. Two of our
        teachers have agreed to guide us during the tour. This study tour will
        cost about TK. 16,000.00. We are ready to contribute half of the total
        expenditure. We, therefore, would request you to kindly permit us to
        make the tour and sanction Tk. 8,000.00 only and oblige thereby.
        Sincerely yours, Priom On behalf of the students of class ten.
